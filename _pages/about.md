I am a geologist with interest in sedimentary geochemistry, sedimentology, and stratigraphy. Sometimes, I also take on the role of a geochemical modeler by crunching a lot of numbers and making plots using Python (or Matlab, but mostly Python).

I was born and raised in Indonesia. I attended [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://geology.fitb.itb.ac.id/) for my undergraduate degree in geology and the School of Earth Sciences at [Ohio State](https://earthsciences.osu.edu/) for my MS and PhD. Currently, I am a postdoctoral scholar at [Florida State University Department of Earth, Ocean & Atmospheric Science (EOAS)](https://www.eoas.fsu.edu/) and [National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab)](https://nationalmaglab.org/staff/?name=YosephAdiatma).

My research centers in reconstructing changes in geologic, oceanic, and paleoclimate processes using geochemical proxies and their roles in shaping the macro-evolution of life on Earth. Overall, my research questions are at the intersection between geology (*sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry*) and paleoclimatology.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, biking, and exploring local coffee shops. I did a couple of races when I was in graduate school (3x Marathons, 1x 9 mile race, 1x 20 mile race, and 1x run-bike-run duathlon). If you are looking for trails to run or coffee shops to go to in Columbus or Tallahassee, please reach out! I will be more than happy to send you some of my favorite trails and coffee shops.
