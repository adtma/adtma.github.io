This is my first blog post in my personal website.

New year resolutions are cliche, but claiming that I actually made a new year resolution to activate the blog post feature on my website in February is not.

I had a blog before, and I did a pretty ok job in maintaining it. It still exists somewhere in the corner of the wild-wild internet. My plan for the current iteration of my blog is focusing on stuff that people may find useful such as: python tips&tricks, posting a summary of a paper I just read, etc.

Cheers!
