I'm super excited to share some amazing news - I've just accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position at Florida State University! üéâ

### The New Adventure

I'll be joining the incredible research team of [Dr. Seth Young](http://www.sethallenyoungphd.com/) and [Dr. Jeremy Owens](https://myweb.fsu.edu/jdowens/) at FSU and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory ([MagLab](https://nationalmaglab.org/)), where we'll be diving deep (literally!) into one of Earth's most fascinating time periods. Our NASA-funded project focuses on understanding how oxygen levels in ancient oceans influenced the explosion of life during a critical transition in Earth's history.

### The Science Behind It

For those curious about the nitty-gritty details (and I know some of you are!), we're investigating the transition between two major events in Earth's history: the Cambrian Radiation and the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event. Think of it as studying the "sequel" to the famous Cambrian explosion, where life on Earth went through some dramatic changes.

The big question we're trying to answer? How did changing oxygen levels in ancient oceans affect the diversity of life during this crucial period? It's like trying to understand how Earth's "breathing" influenced the evolution of its earliest complex creatures.

### Why This Matters

This research isn't just about understanding Earth's past - it could help us better understand how life responds to environmental changes on a global scale. Plus, with NASA funding this project, our findings could even have implications for understanding the potential for life on other planets!

### Looking Forward

I can't wait to start this new chapter in Tallahassee! Between the cutting-edge research facilities at FSU (and MagLab), the brilliant minds I'll be working with, and the chance to contribute to our understanding of Earth's history, I'm beyond thrilled about what's ahead.

Stay tuned for updates on our discoveries, and maybe even some behind-the-scenes looks at life as a postdoc. And yes, I'll try to squeeze in some posts about Florida's famous sunshine between all the lab work! ‚òÄÔ∏è

*P.S. - If you're ever in Tallahassee and want to hear about ancient oxygen levels or see some really old rocks, you know where to find me!*
