Hello! 

My name is Datu, I am a geologist with a passion and (experience) in sedimentology, stratigraphy, and isotope geochemistry. Sometimes, I also take on the role of a geochemical modeler, crunching numbers and creating visualizations using Python (or Matlab, but mostly Python). I published my modeling work [here](https://doi.org/10.1130/G49860.1) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2022.117641) in collaboration with my lab-mates [Chris Conwell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctconwell/) and [Teresa Avila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresa-avila-6872231ba/).

I was born and raised in Indonesia. I attended [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/) for my undergrad and live in Columbus, Ohio. I like coffee, running, and biking, and I have done a couple of races in the past three years (Marathon-3x, 9-mile race-1x, 20-mile race-1x, and run-bike-run duathlon-1x). If you are looking for trails to run or coffee shops to go to in Columbus, please reach out! I will be more than happy to send you some of my favorite trails and coffee shops.

## Research
My research interest lies at the intersection between geology (*sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry*) and paleoclimatology. Specifically, I am interested in investigating the relative importance of various geologic processes in controlling changes in global climate on a multi-million-year time scale.
