Hello! 

My name is Datu, I am a geologist with a passion in sedimentology, stratigraphy, and isotope geochemistry. Sometimes, I also take on the role of a geochemical modeler, crunching numbers and creating visualizations using Python (or Matlab, but mostly Python). I published my modeling work [here](https://doi.org/10.1130/G49860.1) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2022.117641) in collaboration with my lab-mates [Chris Conwell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctconwell/) and [Teresa Avila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresa-avila-6872231ba/).

I was born and raised in Indonesia. I attended [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/) for my undergraduate degree in geology and the School of Earth Sciences at [Ohio State](https://earthsciences.osu.edu/) for my MS and PhD. I currently live in Tallahassee Florida.

Outside of work, I enjoy coffee, running, and biking. I did a couple of races when I was in gradschool (3 Marathons, a 9-mile race, a 20-mile race, and a run-bike-run duathlon). If you are looking for trails to run or coffee shops to go to in Columbus, please reach out! I will be more than happy to send you some of my favorite trails and coffee shops.

## Research
My research centers in reconstructing changes in geologic, oceanic, and paleoclimate processes using geochemical proxies and their roles in shaping the macro-evolution of life on Earth (i.e., long-term changes in biodiversity and rapid mass extinction events). Overall, my research questions are at the intersection between geology (*sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry*) and paleoclimatology.
