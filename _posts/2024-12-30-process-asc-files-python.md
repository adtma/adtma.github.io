In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up Python and using a handy script to process your ASC files. Don't worry if you're new to Python – we'll start from the very beginning!

## Setting Up Python

Before we dive into processing ASC files, let's get Python installed on your computer. The process is a bit different depending on whether you're using Windows or macOS.

### Installing Python on Windows

1. Head over to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Click on the big yellow "Download Python" button (it'll automatically show the latest version)
3. Run the installer you just downloaded
4. **Important**: Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking Install
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Once it's done, open Command Prompt (you can search for "cmd" in the Start menu)
7. Type `python --version` to verify the installation

### Installing Python on macOS

1. First, install Homebrew if you haven't already. Open Terminal and paste this:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Once Homebrew is installed, install Python by typing:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```
3. Verify the installation by typing:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

## Installing Required Libraries

Now that Python is installed, we need to get a few essential libraries. Open your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS) and run these commands:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Getting Started with ASC File Processing

Our script makes it super easy to process ASC files from your instrument. Here's what it can do:

- Combine multiple ASC files from different folders
- Filter specific columns based on your analysis type (Total Digest or Iodine Calcium)
- Calculate blank corrections
- Generate calibration curves
- Calculate concentrations
- Export results in both CSV and Excel formats

### Downloading Required Files

#### Getting the Processing Script
1. Go to the [Mass Spec GitHub repository](https://github.com/datuadiatma/mass_spec)
2. Click on the "Element2" folder
3. Find and click on `load_asc_files.py`
4. Click the "Download raw file" button (it should be near the top right of the code)
5. Save it as `load_asc_files.py` in a folder where you'll process your data

#### Getting the Calibration Table (Optional)
Only needed if you want to produce calibration curves!

1. Go back to the [Mass Spec GitHub repository](https://github.com/datuadiatma/mass_spec)
2. Click on the "Element2" folder
3. Go to the "Calibration table" folder
4. Download the appropriate calibration table for your analysis:
   - For Total Digest analysis: use the Total Digest calibration table
   - For Iodine Calcium analysis: use the I-Ca calibration table
5. Save the calibration table in the same folder as your script

Note: You can skip downloading the calibration table if you're just combining ASC files and don't need to create calibration curves.

### Running the Script with IDLE

IDLE is Python's built-in editor that comes with your Python installation. It's more user-friendly than the command line! Here's how to use it:

1. Find IDLE in your computer:
   - Windows: Search for "IDLE" in the Start menu
   - macOS: Search for "IDLE" in Spotlight (Cmd + Space)
2. In IDLE, go to File → Open and select the `load_asc_files.py` script you downloaded
3. Once the script is open, press F5 or go to Run → Run Module to start the script

The script will guide you through the process with pop-up windows:

1. First, it'll ask if you're processing Total Digest or Iodine Calcium samples
2. Then, you can select ASC files from multiple folders
3. Choose where to save your output files
4. Optionally, provide calibration data if you want to calculate concentrations

### Understanding the Output Files

The script generates several files:

- `*_filtered.csv`: Contains the filtered data based on your analysis type
- `*_blank_statistics.csv`: Statistics about your blank measurements
- `*_original_results.csv`: Results without blank correction
- `*_blank_corrected_results.csv`: Results with blank correction applied
- `*_coefficients.csv`: Calibration coefficients
- `*_calibration_table.csv`: Detailed calibration data

Plus, you'll get nice calibration curve plots saved as PNG files!

## Tips and Tricks

- Make sure your sample names follow the standard format (the script recognizes "std" for standards and "bl" for blanks)
- Keep your calibration table in CSV format with proper column headers
- Back up your original ASC files before processing
- Check the blank statistics to ensure your blanks are consistent

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues:

- Make sure all required libraries are installed
- Check that your ASC files are in the correct format
- Verify that your calibration table matches the expected format
- Look for any error messages in the command prompt/terminal

## Need Help?

This script is pretty robust, but if you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out. Common issues usually involve:

- File format mismatches
- Missing libraries
- Incorrect sample naming
- Path/permission issues

*Note: This guide assumes you're working with ASC files from a Thermo Element2 sector field ICP MS, using the method that I setup on (YDA_Trace_Metal.met or YDA_I_Ca.met). You might need to modify the script if your instrument outputs files in a different format.*
